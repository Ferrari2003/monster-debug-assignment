<!-- undefine -->

<p>4.undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

    In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)
    
    A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.</p>
